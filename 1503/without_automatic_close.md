# 📘 Project Documentation: Automatic Door Controller using Arduino

---

## 🧩 1. Overview

This project controls an **automatic sliding door** using:
- A **DC motor** with **PWM speed control**
- An **encoder** to track door position
- **Open/Close buttons**
- A **home sensor** for calibration
- Smart motion control for **smooth acceleration and deceleration**
- **Emergency handling** for button presses during motion

---

## 🚪 2. Real-World Analogy

### Imagine:
You have a **hotel room door** that:
- On power-up: opens once to find its full open position (homing)
- Waits for user to press **Open** or **Close**
- If it’s **already open**, it won’t try to open again.
- If you press **Close while Opening**, it will stop and reverse the motion — like catching an elevator door closing and pushing it open again.

Now, to avoid **slamming** and damage, the door:
- Starts **fast**
- Then **slows down** near the end to land **smoothly**

Just like a train slowing down before the station.

## 🔧 3. Components Used

| Component       | Function                                   |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Arduino Uno     | Main controller                            |
| DC Motor         | Drives the door                           |
| Encoder (Quadrature) | Tracks motor rotation for position     |
| Motor Driver (L298N etc.) | Controls direction & speed       |
| Home Sensor     | Tells us when door is fully open (position = 0) |
| Open/Close Buttons | Manual controls                         |

## 💻 4. Main Features

1. **Homing at startup**  
   Moves door open until home sensor is triggered (LOW input)
2. **Encoder-based position tracking**  
   - `0` = door fully open  
   - `-1000` = door fully closed  
3. **Smooth motion profile**  
   - Start fast  
   - Slow down before end
4. **Emergency interruption handling**
   - Interrupt `close` with `open` and vice versa
5. **Debugging output**
   - Encoder count + current speed printed constantly

---

## 🔁 5. Code Flow Breakdown

### 🔄 `setup()`
```cpp
Serial.begin(115200);
```
Starts communication at **115200 baud** so serial monitor prints fast and clean (important for fast updates like encoder/speed).

```cpp
homeDoor();
```
Immediately performs **homing** to calibrate the position system.

---

### 🏠 `homeDoor()`
1. Sets direction to **open**
2. Moves until the **home sensor** is triggered (door fully open)
3. Stops the motor
4. Resets `encoderCount = 0`

#### Analogy:
Like opening your window fully so you know exactly where "open" is before anything else.

---

### 🔄 `loop()`
- If homing not done, ignores button presses
- If **open button is pressed**:
  - Opens door only if not already open
- If **close button is pressed**:
  - Closes door only if not already closed

---

### 🔃 `handleOpen()` and `handleClose()`
These functions:
- Check current door state using `encoderCount`
- Avoid redundant movement
- Start movement in the right direction
- Use `moveDoor()` with direction and limits

---

## 🚦 6. Motion Control with `moveDoor()`

This is the brain of motion.

It:
- Accepts:
  - Direction (open/close)
  - Slowdown point (like -800 or -200)
  - Final target position (0 or -1000)

### 🧠 How it works:
1. Starts motor at **MAX_SPEED**
2. Checks distance to slowdown point (e.g., distance to -200)
3. If getting close, uses:
```cpp
map(distanceToSlowdown, 600, 0, MAX_SPEED, MIN_SPEED)
```
To **dynamically reduce speed**.
4. Constantly checks for:
   - Encoder count
   - Interrupting button press (for emergency)

### 🧮 Example:
- Door is at `-950` and closing.
- As it reaches `-800`, speed reduces gradually.
- At `-1000`, motor stops.

#### Real Analogy:
Like a car braking gently before red light, not all at once!

## 🚨 7. Emergency Handling

**If**:
- Opening and user presses **Close**
- Closing and user presses **Open**

→ Motor **stops**  
→ Opposite action is triggered

This avoids:
- Crashes
- Logic breaking
- Over-torque

---

## 🔢 8. Example Run (Numbers)

- You boot the system:
  - Door moves right until home sensor is hit
  - Encoder = `0`
- You press Close:
  - Motor direction → LOW
  - Encoder goes `-10`, `-100` ... `-950`, `-1000`
  - Slows down before `-800`
- You press Open during close at `-500`:
  - Motor stops
  - Opens from `-500` to `0`

---

## 📊 9. Debug Output Sample
```
=== Door System Booted ===
Starting homing sequence...
[Homing] Moving towards home sensor...
[Homing] Encoder: -20
[Homing] Completed. Encoder reset to 0.
========================================
Ready for operation. Awaiting input...

[ACTION] Closing door...
[MOVING] Closing...
[ENC] Encoder: -800 | Speed: 150
[ENC] Encoder: -950 | Speed: 120
[DONE] Door movement complete.

[EMERGENCY] Close interrupted by Open. Stopping...
[ACTION] Opening door...
[MOVING] Opening...
[ENC] Encoder: -450 | Speed: 220
[ENC] Encoder: 0 | Speed: 120
[DONE] Door movement complete.
```

## 🧪 10. How to Test

1. ✅ Power up → check if door opens till home sensor
2. ✅ Press Close → check smooth deceleration and end stop
3. ✅ Press Open mid-way during close → see emergency stop and open
4. ✅ Try repeated open while already open → check if system avoids redundant actions

---

## 🧼 11. Clean Code & Performance

- Code avoids:
  - Blocking delays during motion
  - Duplicate logic
  - Overuse of Serial
- Uses flags: `isOpening`, `isClosing`, `isHomed`
- Constant encoder + speed print to help debug mechanical errors

---

## 🧠 12. Why It Works Smoothly

✅ Starts fast  
✅ Decelerates by mapping distance  
✅ Handles sudden interrupts  
✅ Avoids bouncing or stalling  
✅ Protects motor by reducing load torque at ends

---

## 🔄 13. Next Add-ons (Optional Upgrades)

- ⏱ Auto-close after some seconds of open
- 📲 Bluetooth App control (ESP32)
- 📟 OLED display for door status
- 🔐 IR/Face/QR sensor for auto entry
- 🧠 Machine Learning to predict open time? (fun side project)
