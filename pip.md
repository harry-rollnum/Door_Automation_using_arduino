Yeah bro, totally possible! You **can skip pip‚Äôs index check** and **install `.whl` files directly**, even **without a `requirements.txt`**. Here‚Äôs your offline install **Plan B** (aka the ‚Äúbrute force but effective‚Äù way):

### ‚úÖ **Step-by-Step: Install `.whl` files directly**

Assuming you're on the **offline machine**, and you‚Äôve copied your `ai_ml_packages` folder (containing all `.whl` files):

1. **Navigate to the folder:**

```bash
cd /path/to/ai_ml_packages
```

2. **Install all the `.whl` files in one go:**

```bash
pip install --no-index --find-links=. *.whl
```

> üî• This will install *everything* in that folder.  
> No internet? No problem. No index lookup involved.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Got Dependency Issues?

Sometimes a package depends on something that‚Äôs *not* in your `.whl` collection. Here's how to be safe:

- Always install **core dependencies first** (e.g., `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`) before the big boys like `matplotlib`, `tensorflow`, etc.
- If pip yells about a missing dependency, download it separately on your internet system and copy it into the folder.

### üí° Bonus Tip: List Order Install (Optional)

If you want to be *super clean*, you can install the wheels one-by-one in order like this:

```bash
pip install --no-index --find-links=. numpy-2.2.3-*.whl
pip install --no-index --find-links=. pandas-2.2.3-*.whl
pip install --no-index --find-links=. matplotlib-3.10.1-*.whl
...
```

But that‚Äôs extra effort unless you‚Äôre debugging issues.

Let me know if you're targeting a specific Python version (`cp312` = Python 3.12), because mismatches between wheel Python versions (`cp310`, `cp311`, etc.) and your actual Python install will also cause this "No matching distribution" error. I can help fix that too. üõ†Ô∏è
