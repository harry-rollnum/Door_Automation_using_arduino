**Title:**  
**Intelligent Automatic Door System Using Arduino and Encoder-Based Control with Smooth Motor Management**

**Authors:**

### üîπ Abstract:

In this project, we design and implement an intelligent automatic door system that leverages an Arduino Uno, a DC motor, encoder feedback, and sensor-based homing to enable smooth, efficient, and safe door automation. The system ensures smart control using direction pins, speed modulation, emergency stops, and button-based manual overrides. This paper presents the design approach, control logic, safety features, and a modular software implementation. Emphasis is placed on real-world feasibility and academic value for embedded systems and mechatronics learners.

### 1. **Introduction:**

Automatic doors are widely used in commercial and residential areas to improve user convenience and accessibility. Traditional systems rely on basic timers or motion detection, lacking fine control over door movement or speed.

This project introduces a **microcontroller-based automatic door system** with intelligent homing and **encoder-based positioning**. We explore acceleration/deceleration logic, real-time control, and edge safety measures (like emergency stops) through hardware-software integration using Arduino.

### 2. **System Design and Components:**

#### 2.1 Hardware:

- **Microcontroller:** Arduino Uno R3
- **Motor Driver:** PCW board
- **Motor:** DC Motor (2-pin control)
- **Power:** SMPS supply unit
- **Inputs:**
  - Limit/Home Sensor (pull-up, LOW when triggered)
  - Manual Buttons (Open, Close - active LOW)
  - Rotary Encoder (Incremental)
  
#### 2.2 Block Diagram:

                    [PWM + DIR Pins]
```

### 3. **Software Logic and Algorithm:**

#### 3.1 Homing Sequence:

- On startup, door opens until home sensor triggers.
- Encoder count reset to 0 at home.
- Buttons are locked during this phase.

#### 3.2 Open/Close Controls:

| Action | Condition | Result |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Open Button | Door not already open | Door opens |
| Close Button | Door not already closed | Door closes |
| Open during closing | Emergency stop ‚Üí start opening |
| Close during opening | Emergency stop |

#### 3.3 Smooth Motor Control:

- Speed increases gradually if encoder doesn't move (to overcome inertia).
- Once motion detected, speed ramps down to avoid crashes.

---

### 4. **Implementation:**

The code is modular, readable, and includes:

- Real-time encoder tracking.
- Intelligent direction logic.
- Button debouncing using active LOW.
- Auto-close after a delay post-opening.
- Debug flags to toggle serial logs.

---

### 5. **Experimental Results:**

| Test Case | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Homing | Door opens, detects home sensor, sets encoder to 0 |
| Manual Open/Close | Button press correctly moves door |
| Emergency Stop | Pressing opposite button mid-movement halts motor |
| Smooth Landing | Speed is lower near limits for safe stopping |
| Encoder Feedback | Real-time count matches expected positions |

---

### 6. **Conclusion and Future Scope:**

This project showcases a reliable and smooth automatic door controller with user interactivity and mechanical safety. The encoder integration makes the system precise and scalable.

#### üîÆ Future Improvements:

- IR proximity-based open triggers
- Wi-Fi control (ESP8266 integration)
- LCD status display or app-based UI
